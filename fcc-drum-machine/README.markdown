# FCC - Drum Machine

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/jtoaha/pen/Vwewpbv](https://codepen.io/jtoaha/pen/Vwewpbv).


This Drum Machine is built as part of the Free Code Camp Front End Libraries Track. It is implemented by using React.js, vanilla CSS, and a bit of JQuery(primarily to add event handlers and CSS for mouse and keyboard events). Drum audio is accessed and streamed via DropBox, where I stored MP3 files.

Overview: This Drum Machine project sets up a drum machine user can interact with, either by:
- Pressing corresponding letter on their keyboard (i.e, Q, W, E, A, S, D, Z, X, C)
- Or simply pressing the button
Every button corresponds to a different sound effect.
Notable CSS Effects added: When user presses keyboard or clicks on button, CSS shows feedback by showing the button being pressed in and briefly changing it's background color. Flexbox added so buttons space out evenly and is responsive across different screen sizes.

Original Sound Effects Source: [http://www.flashkit.com/soundfx](http://www.flashkit.com/soundfx) This is a great website for sound effects. However, once Flash totally becomes obsolete by the end of 2020 may become more diffcult to navigate.
